#QT += core: This includes the QtCore module, which provides core non-GUI functionality. This includes data types, threads, QObjects (the base class for all Qt objects), event handling, and more.
#QT += widgets: This includes the QtWidgets module, which provides a set of UI elements to create classic desktop-style user interfaces.
#QT += gui: This includes the QtGui module, which provides the graphical foundation for the QtWidgets module. Itâ€™s also used for working with images, fonts, text rendering, and more.
